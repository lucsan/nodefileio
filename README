A simple nodejs IO file and folder creator (and deletor) using async calls.

:memo: Note: I wrote this on a MS machine, windows doesn't support recursive folder deletion.


Package.json entry to install nodefileio from github via npm

```
"dependencies": {
  "nodefileio": "lucsan/nodefileio"
}
```

If you've implemented via npm you can use this in your project
```
const fio = require('nodefileio')
```

:briefcase: useCase.js demonstrates usage of nodefileio.
