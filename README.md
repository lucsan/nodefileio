### 🛠 NodeFileIO
A simple nodejs IO file and folder creator (and deletor) using async calls.

📝 I wrote this on a MS machine, windows doesn't support recursive folder deletion.


Package.json entry to install nodefileio from github via npm

```javascript
"dependencies": {
  "nodefileio": "lucsan/nodefileio"
}
```

If you've implemented via npm you can use this in your project to include nodefileio in your project.
```javascript
const fio = require('nodefileio')
```


:briefcase: `useCase.js` demonstrates usage of nodefileio.
  - 📝 Use `node node_modules/nodefileio/useCase.js`
